# Optimizing Revenue and Occupancy Rates for Short-term Rentals in NYC

Welcome to the Pillow Palooza GitHub profile! As a real estate start-up focused on disrupting the traditional market, we are committed to offering short-term rental options for travelers in New York City. To stay ahead in this rapidly growing market, we understand the importance of data-driven decision-making. This repository serves as a central hub for our data analysis project aimed at maximizing revenue and occupancy rates for short-term rentals.

## Project Background

The short-term rental market in NYC has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the popularity of online booking platforms like Airbnb and changing traveler preferences. As a result, numerous real estate start-ups, including Pillow Palooza, have emerged to capitalize on the opportunities presented by this evolving market.

To gain a competitive edge, Pillow Palooza has collected data from various sources on Airbnb listings in NYC. Our goal is to leverage data analysis techniques, such as data cleaning, SQL queries, and data visualization, to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations.

## Objective

As a Data Analyst at Pillow Palooza, our objective is to provide insights into the short-term rental market in New York City. By analyzing the Airbnb listing data, we aim to uncover key trends in popular neighborhoods, rental prices, property types, length of stay, and demand over time. These insights will guide our business decisions regarding neighborhood investments, property types, and competitive pricing strategies.

## Data Analysis and Data Cleaning

We have started by receiving three unstructured datasets in Excel and TSV formats, which include prices, room types, and reviews. Our first step was to ensure data quality and consistency through a comprehensive cleaning process using Python. We handled missing values, removed duplicates, and performed necessary transformations. The cleaned datasets were then converted into a standardized CSV file format.

## SQL and Data Analysis

To extract insights from the dataset and answer specific questions, we utilized SQL in the analysis phase. We addressed several questions, such as the most common room types, average price by room type, highest average price per borough, listings by room type in each borough, and more.

## Deliverables

Our project was divided into three main parts:

1. Data Wrangling and Cleaning: The NYC Airbnb dataset was imported into Python, cleaned, and prepared. The resulting cleaned dataset was exported in CSV format.

2. Data Analysis and Insights Generation: We imported the cleaned and preprocessed data into bit.io, created a schema for further analysis, and generated insights by running SQL queries to answer specific questions.

3. Presenting Findings for Business Impact: We used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard and story points, along with a video based on the analysis of the NYC Airbnb dataset. Additional Airbnb data was provided to enhance the analysis and insights.

## Findings and Recommendations

Based on our data analysis, we have identified key insights and recommendations for Pillow Palooza's business strategy:

1. **Focus on Entire Home/Apartment and Private Rooms:** These room types dominate the NYC Airbnb market. Prioritize offering these options to cater to the high demand.

2. **Consider Pricing Strategies:** Determine competitive pricing within your chosen room types to attract guests while maintaining profit margins.

3. **Target Manhattan and Brooklyn:** These boroughs generate a substantial amount of revenue. Establish a strong presence in these areas to tap into the lucrative market.

4. **Explore Opportunities in Other Boroughs:** Consider offering more affordable options in the Bronx and other boroughs to target budget-conscious travelers.

5. **Neighborhood-Specific Pricing:** Analyze average prices per month in different neighborhoods and adjust pricing accordingly.

6. **Emphasize Customer Reviews and Availability:** Encourage guests to provide reviews and ensure listings have a minimum number of reviews and availability days to maintain competitive prices.

7. **Marketing and Differentiation:** Stand out from the competition through effective marketing and highlighting unique features of listings.

8. **Customer Satisfaction and Service:** Prioritize excellent customer service and responsiveness to maintain a positive reputation.

9. **Monitor Market Trends:** Stay informed about changes in pricing, demand, and customer preferences to adapt strategies accordingly.

10. **Partner with Airbnb and Utilize Data:** Consider partnering with Airbnb to access valuable insights and reach a wider audience.

By implementing these recommendations and developing a comprehensive business plan, Pillow Palooza can maximize revenue and enhance customer satisfaction, solidifying its position as a leading player in the NYC short-term rental market.
